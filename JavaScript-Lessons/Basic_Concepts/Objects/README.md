## Objects

In our example for objects we used the following code:  
  

    var person = {
        name: "Bucky",
        age: 87
    }; 

   
  That is the typical syntax of  javascripts object as well:
    
    var objectname = {
	    property1: "property1valueinstringformat",
	    property2: property2valueinarithmeticformat
	    };

We achieve to insert more values in one variable by turning it to an object and by use the "property" format to each of our value
	

	    { property: valueofproperty };

  Curley brackets are defining the are of the properties, and also they defining that our variable is an object, and we separate our properties with the comma symbol.
