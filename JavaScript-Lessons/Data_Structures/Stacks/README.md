# Stacks

A stack is a data structure that can be logically thought of as a real physical stack or pile, a structure where
insertion and deletion of items takes place at one end only called the "top" of the stack. The basic concept can be
illustrated by thinking of your data set as a stack of plates or books where you can only take the top item off the
stack in order to remove things from it.
